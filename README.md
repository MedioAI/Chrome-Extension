# Me-dio for UdioAI

### Enhance your experience with Udio

A chrome extension to enhance the experience of Udio.com, an AI music platform.

Currently will check the number of generations and see if they match, example: 0/2 will do nothing but 2/2 will trigger a notification and audio sound, "Ding, fries are done"

More features in future:

1. ChatGPT integration for lyric writing
2. Lyric review, via a fictional chat
3. And other ideas.

Will be on web store sooner or later.

Any additions and improvements welcome.

This is very MVP and just to get ball rolling.

##### How to Install

Download and go to `chrome://extensions` turn on developer mode and "load unpacked" and open the folder and click select. Then check console log to make sure it is loaded or try making a song and see if asks for notification or says "ding, fries are done"
